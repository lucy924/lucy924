## Welcome! I'm Lucy! 👋

I am a final-year PhD student from New Zealand, with a background in bioinformatic engineering in the precision medicine industry. 
I love learning about new technology and jump at opportunities to incorporate this into my work. I am passionate about improving access to precision medicine in clinical care for patients and clinical teams, particularly in cancer genetics and epigenetics.
